**Tips for increasing the luck for entering The Backrooms:**

- Walls that are a shade darker in abandoned buildings
- Doors that look like they shouldn't lead anywhere or are in a random place
- Any area that gives paranormal feelings (hair standing up, buzzing, electric currents, sense of unease)
- Missing the last step on a flight of stairs and falling on your face. (This usually does not work, only in very select flights of stairs, the anomalous properties of said stairs disappear/move after 2 or so entries using this method.)
- Interacting with a corrupted object, such as a glitched chair.
