## Sub-Layers
----------

 Sub-Layers are locations that usually add more detail to an existing level. There are two types of Sub-Layers â€” "Sub-Levels" and "Rooms".

**Sub-Levels:**

 Sub-Levels are levels that are related to their parent level, but are still their own distinct level.

**Rooms:**

 Rooms are locations that are too small to be considered their own level. Usually, they are places in an existing level.
