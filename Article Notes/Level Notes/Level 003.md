## Level 3
-------

### Survival Difficulty:

***Class:** 4*

- *Unsafe*
- *Unsecure*
- *Medium Entity Count*

**General Description:**

 Level 3 is a series of long, dark, twisting hallways that work similarly to Level 0. They all consist of randomly segmented rooms, and are extremely loud with the noises of machinery. The hallways are very narrow and enclosed, some even requiring wanderers of average height and build to traverse.

**General Notes:**

- As it is highly unlikely aid will come should you need it, it is advised you only enter Level 3 if you are prepared to defend yourself.
- Due to its massive size, encounters with other wanderers is scarce.
- There are indestructable obstructions that make it impossible to traverse into certain regions of the level.
- Areas with prison bars are reported to induce a heightened sense of fear and extreme discomfort. Some wanderers claim to feel like being watched or even see figures behind the bars.
- The black sludge that flows through the pipes of this level is highly toxic, emits deadly fumes that damage the nervous system and causes 2nd or 3rd degree burns in contact.
- Out-of-place electrical rooms inside the level contain single generators and electrical or electronic appliances like computers, loose wires etc.
- Level 3 is considered, while relatively dangerous, a hotspot for supply bases due to its rich resources such as almond water, false outlets, liquid pain, firesalt, royal rations, squirt guns and bottled lightning. Along with these, items that are not native to The Backrooms can be found such as knives, lighters, bolt cutters, flashligths and miscellaneous weapons or supplies.
- Wi-Fi in The Backrooms is at its strongest in Level 3 with a consistent three or four bars.
- Abundant machinery causes the temperatures to be uncomfortably warm but bearable.
- The machinery in the level can spontaneously combust or explode, injuring wanderers that happen to be around. This can be circumvented by planning a safe route for traversing the level.
